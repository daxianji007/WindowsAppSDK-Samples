# Sample Template Usage

This `SharedContents` folder contains sample templates for C# and C++ (using WinUI 3). To use the templates, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the Windows App SDK samples repo and then copy all the files under the appropriate template folder to your feature sample directory.

2. Rename the sample solution and project files to your feature name. For example, rename *WinUI3TemplateCs* to *MyCoolFeatureName*.

3. Rename the Scenario pages to a short description of the API functionality you are demonstrating. For example, rename *Scenario1_ShortName* to *Scenario1_CopyImage*.
